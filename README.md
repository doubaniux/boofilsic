## Contribution
The project is based on Django. If you are familiar with this technique and willing to read through the terrible codeüòù, your contribution would be the most welcome!

Currently looking for someone to help with:
- Writing instrucations on how to deploy this
- Explaining the structure of code
- Refactoring (this is something big)

This project is still in its early stage, so you are not encouraged to deploy it on your own. If you do want to give it a try, please check the [fork of *alphatownsman*](https://github.com/alphatownsman/boofilsic), which is more friendly.

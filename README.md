# Boofilsic
An application allows you to mark any books, movies and more things you love. 

Depends on Mastodon.

## Contribution
The project is based on Django. If you are familiar with this technique and willing to read through the terrible codeüòù, your contribution would be the most welcome!

Currently looking for someone to help with:
- Writing instrucations on how to deploy this
- Explaining the structure of code
- Refactoring (this is something big)

## Deployment
This project is still in its early stage, so you are not encouraged to deploy it on your own. If you do want to give it a try, please check the [fork of *alphatownsman*](https://github.com/alphatownsman/boofilsic), which is more friendly.

## Sponsor
If you like this project, please consider sponsoring us on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/tertius).
